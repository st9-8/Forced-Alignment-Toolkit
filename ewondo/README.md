## Ewondo G2P Resources

This folder supports efforts to build an IPA grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model for Ewondo with Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA).

## Current Focus
- Collect lexicons and verify orthographic conventions.
- Define consistent grapheme-to-phoneme mappings in IPA.
- Package pronunciation dictionaries that MFA can ingest.

## Suggested Workflow
1. Aggregate Ewondo word lists and keep the raw sources documented here.
2. Normalize the data and export a tab-separated word ↔ IPA file.
3. Train and evaluate the MFA G2P model before running alignment experiments.

Status: Lexicon sourcing is ongoing; please add references or datasets as they become available.
