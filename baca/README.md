## Baca G2P Resources

This folder gathers material for training an IPA grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model for Baca with Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA).

## Current Focus
- Source and normalize orthographic word lists.
- Convert entries to canonical IPA pronunciations.
- Prepare pronunciation dictionary files compatible with MFA.

## Suggested Workflow
1. Collect raw lexicon data and save it in this directory.
2. Clean spelling variants and produce a tab-separated word ↔ IPA file.
3. Train and evaluate the MFA G2P model to support forced alignment experiments.

Status: Lexicon collection is in progress and community contributions are welcome.
